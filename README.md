# Fourier Series
A simple representation of the Fourier Series, written in JavaScript.
Depicts the formation of the Sawtooth wave and the Square wave from the summation of sinusoids.
The animation begins without any option selected and the drawing can begin with the selection of either
one of the waves. From there, increase the slider to add more iterations to the series and see how the
approximation is strengthened.
